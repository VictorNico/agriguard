      "q1": {
        "question": "How to diagnose plant diseases with the application?",
        "answer": "Simply take a clear photo of the diseased plant ensuring that symptoms are clearly visible. Our AI will analyze the image and provide you with an accurate diagnosis along with appropriate treatment recommendations."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is the accuracy of automatic diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Our artificial intelligence system achieves over 95% accuracy on the most common diseases. It is trained on a database of over 100,000 diseased plant images validated by expert phytopathologists."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What are the most common diseases detected?",
        "answer": "The application can detect over 200 different diseases including fungal diseases (downy mildew, powdery mildew, rust), bacterial diseases (fire blight, bacterial spots), viral diseases (mosaic, yellowing), and nutritional deficiencies."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How to differentiate between a disease and a nutritional deficiency?",
        "answer": "Diseases often present localized symptoms with specific shapes (spots, halos, sporulation), while deficiencies generally affect the plant more uniformly with characteristic color changes (yellowing, browning)."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What treatments are recommended for fungal diseases?",
        "answer": "Treatments vary depending on the disease: preventive fungicides (bordeaux mixture, sulfur), curative treatments (triazoles, strobilurins), and biological methods (Bacillus subtilis, plant extracts). It's important to respect doses and application timing."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How to prevent plant diseases?",
        "answer": "Prevention relies on several pillars: crop rotation, choosing resistant varieties, irrigation management, crop aeration, tool disinfection, and regular monitoring. A healthy environment significantly reduces risks."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Does the application work offline?",
        "answer": "Yes, once downloaded, the application can work offline for basic diagnostics. However, an internet connection is required to access the latest database updates and advanced features."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How to improve the quality of my photos for better diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Take sharp photos with good natural lighting, frame symptoms closely, avoid strong shadows, and take multiple angles if necessary. A distance of 20-30 cm from the affected area is generally optimal."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What to do if the application doesn't recognize my plant?",
        "answer": "You can submit your case to our experts via the 'Ask expert advice' function. Include multiple photos from different angles and describe the observed symptoms. Our team will respond within 24-48 hours."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "When to apply preventive treatments?",
        "answer": "Preventive treatments are more effective before symptoms appear, generally in early spring or according to weather conditions favorable to diseases (high humidity, mild temperatures). Check the treatment calendar in the application."
